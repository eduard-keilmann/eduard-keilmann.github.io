I am a Doctoral Candidate at the University of Cologne in the Physics Department at the research group of Prof. Dr. Dominik Riechers. My research interests range from the dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM) and stellar feedback to giant molecular cloud properties conducive for star formation in our Galaxy as well as external galaxies such as M33.

A sample of my research interests can be found in ![Research Interests](research.md). A list of my publications as first author and co-author is located ![here](publications.md) and my CV is found ![here](CV.md). If you are interested in some more personal note about myself, you can find a bit ![here](about_me.md).
