In this A&A Letter to the Editor I show that the infamous [CII]-deficit (relative to the far-IR flux) can be explained by [CII] self-absorption without the need for secondary effects, at least in the young Galactic bubble we study (S144 in RCW79). Correcting for the missing flux makes the [CII]-deficit vanish. In extragalactic, more extreme or evolved regions further effects might however become important.
