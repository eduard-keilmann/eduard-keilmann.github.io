title: "[CII]-deficit in RCW79"
layout: post
---

We show that the notorious [CII]-deficit (relative to the far-IR flux) can be explained by [CII] self-absorption without the need for secondary effects, at least in the young galactic bubble we study here (S144 in RCW79). Correcting for the missing flux makes the deficit vanish. In extragalactic, more extreme or evolved regions further effects might however become important.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
