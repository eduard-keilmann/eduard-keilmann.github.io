I have written a number of research articles since my master's thesis, doctorate, and afterwards. At the NASA ADS database you will easily find all my work listed, from which you can access all open access research articles:  
[NASA ADS list of publications](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq_database=(database%3Aastronomy%20OR%20database%3Aphysics)&q=%20author%3A"keilmann%2C%20eduard"&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0)  



My PhD dissertation is hosted at the [University of Cologne](https://kups.ub.uni-koeln.de/78534/) or also [here](assets/Dissertation_Eduard_Keilmann_publ_komp.pdf).


I am excited to share with you my first public outreach talk (in German), which I gave on September 5, 2025 in Frankfurt (Physikalischer Verein) to a somewhat larger audience, about why stars do not form as quickly as we might think. It was streamed live on Youtube and you can (re-)watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgepIpD3-PE).
