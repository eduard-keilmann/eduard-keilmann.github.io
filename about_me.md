I have studied Physics (Bachelor and Master of Science) at the University of Mainz, specializing in (theoretical) particle physics.
With starting my PhD at the University of Cologne I began to dig deeper into astrophysics, especially into star formation and the dynamcis of the interstellar medium (ISM).
